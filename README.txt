This is a test for a Junior JS Developer for Severstal.\
A future employee has to perform following tasks:\
\
1. Make up an html page with input field for search and also lists for filters (different columns including date).\
2. Create a random JSON file and make it appear on the index page.\
3. Perform search through the page and also adjust filters.\
4. Build a project with the Gulp toolkit.}


VER1 - What's done
1. Created an HTML with a local .json file from where we extract data.
2. A function that displays data from local .json file,
3. A search function that performs a search through the generated table,
4. Using GULP JS files were concatenated into one,
5. Using GULP the concatenated JS file was minimized. (I keep original JS files in /src)
